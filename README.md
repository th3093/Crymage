# Crymage
Encrypt and Decrypt Text Messages to .png files

For easy use, start gui.py for simple gui application.
console use is available via crymage.py (for further information look into documentation in code)

msg_to_img_decrypt_encrypt_rgb.py was basic idea of encoding text to rgb. Though encoded image has serious color marks and decoding wasnt that good.
msg_to_img_decrypt_encrypt_rgba.py was second idea of encoding via alpha channel but lead to several blind spots. decoding isnt implemented therefor.

run requirements.txt for setup packages ( only pillow)
